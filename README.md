# Custom Themes

Custom themes is a collection of third-party repos that are
related to themes that I use in my desktop. It can be the hole
theme or just a set of wallpapers. This repo was made to make my
life easier on clonning the repos in another machine if I need
to, or even just update all repos at once.
